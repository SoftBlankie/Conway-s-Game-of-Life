### Goal

The goal of this creation was to familiarize myself with Python and Pygame as well as explore the use of Conway's game of life. All credits for this variant goes to [bennutall](https://gist.github.com/bennuttall) for my understanding.

### Implementation

The program generates a random grid upon initialization and calculates the number of neighbors around each cell. According to the rules of conway, each cell is then determined whether to repopulate or die depending on it's neighbors. Upon completion, each cell is deemed to be static or oscillating as all cells reach it's completion.
